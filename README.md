Family Hub is a web application that helps families stay connected, soon to be complete with miniapps. Families can create their own family group, and users can join using a unique code to create their user account within that family.  

From the dashboard, family members will eventually be able to access mini-apps to share memories, chat, plan events, play games and more.  

Right now, the app supports creating families, joining families with a code, and managing user accounts within those families.
